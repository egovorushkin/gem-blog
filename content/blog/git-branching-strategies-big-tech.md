# Git Branching Strategies: How Big Tech Companies Scale Development

Managing code across thousands of developers is one of the biggest challenges in modern software development. Big tech companies like Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Netflix have evolved sophisticated Git branching strategies that enable rapid development while maintaining code quality and system stability.

## The Challenge: Scale and Velocity

When you have 10,000+ engineers committing code daily across hundreds of services, traditional Git workflows break down. Consider these numbers:

- **Google**: ~25,000 engineers, 2 billion lines of code
- **Microsoft**: ~40,000 engineers across Azure, Office, Windows
- **Meta**: ~15,000 engineers, millions of commits per week

Traditional Git Flow with long-lived feature branches simply doesn't work at this scale.

## Trunk-Based Development: The Gold Standard

Most big tech companies have converged on **trunk-based development** as their primary strategy.

### What is Trunk-Based Development?

```bash
main (trunk)
├── commit A
├── commit B (feature X)
├── commit C (feature Y) 
├── commit D (hotfix)
└── commit E (feature Z)
```

Key characteristics:
- All developers commit directly to `main` or very short-lived branches
- Branches live for hours or days, not weeks
- Continuous integration runs on every commit
- Feature flags control feature rollouts

### Why Big Tech Loves It

**1. Reduced Merge Conflicts**
```bash
# Traditional approach - conflicts accumulate
feature-branch (7 days old)
├── 50 commits behind main
└── Major merge conflicts

# Trunk-based - always in sync
main
├── Small commits integrated immediately
└── Minimal conflicts
```

**2. Faster Feedback Loops**
- Code review happens on small changes
- CI/CD pipelines run continuously
- Issues are caught within hours, not weeks

**3. Simplified Release Management**
- Any commit on main can be released
- Rollbacks are straightforward
- Hotfixes don't require complex branching

## Company-Specific Strategies

### Google's Approach: Monorepo + Trunk

Google pioneered massive-scale trunk-based development:

```bash
# Google's simplified workflow
main
├── android/ (Android team commits)
├── chrome/ (Chrome team commits)
├── cloud/ (GCP team commits)
└── search/ (Search team commits)
```

**Key practices:**
- Single monorepo with 2+ billion lines of code
- Custom tooling (Piper, Blaze) for scale
- Automated testing at commit time
- Code ownership via OWNERS files

### Microsoft's Hybrid Model

Microsoft uses a combination based on product needs:

**Azure Services**: Pure trunk-based
```bash
main
├── immediate integration
├── feature flags for gradual rollout
└── automated deployment pipelines
```

**Windows**: Release branches
```bash
main
├── windows-11-22h2 (release branch)
├── windows-11-23h1 (release branch)
└── continuous development
```

### Meta's Scaled Trunk

Meta combines trunk-based development with sophisticated tooling:

```bash
main
├── Sapling VCS (custom Git alternative)
├── Automated code review (Phabricator)
├── Continuous deployment
└── A/B testing infrastructure
```

### Netflix's Microservices Strategy

Netflix uses trunk-based development per service:

```bash
# Each microservice has its own repo
user-service/
├── main (trunk-based)
├── automated testing
└── independent deployments

recommendation-service/
├── main (trunk-based)
├── canary deployments
└── feature experimentation
```

## Modern Branching Patterns

### 1. Feature Flags Over Feature Branches

Instead of:
```bash
# Traditional feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-algorithm
# ... 2 weeks of development
git merge feature/new-algorithm
```

Big tech does:
```javascript
// Code with feature flag
if (featureFlag.isEnabled('new-algorithm', userId)) {
    return newAlgorithm.process(data);
} else {
    return legacyAlgorithm.process(data);
}
```

### 2. Stacked Diffs (Meta's Innovation)

Breaking large changes into small, dependent commits:

```bash
# Stack of related changes
D1: Add new API endpoint structure
D2: Implement core logic (depends on D1)
D3: Add error handling (depends on D2)
D4: Update documentation (depends on D3)
```

### 3. Parallel Development Tracks

For major rewrites or experiments:

```bash
main
├── current production code
experimental/new-architecture
├── parallel development
├── periodic syncing with main
└── eventual migration strategy
```

## Tooling That Makes It Possible

### Automated Testing Infrastructure

```yaml
# Example CI pipeline (simplified)
on_commit:
  - unit_tests: ~5 minutes
  - integration_tests: ~15 minutes
  - security_scans: ~10 minutes
  - performance_tests: ~30 minutes
  
on_merge_to_main:
  - full_regression_suite: ~2 hours
  - deploy_to_staging: automatic
  - canary_deployment: automated with monitoring
```

### Code Review Automation

```python
# Automated code review checks
def pre_submit_checks():
    return [
        check_test_coverage(min_coverage=80),
        check_security_vulnerabilities(),
        check_performance_regression(),
        check_code_style(),
        verify_documentation_updates()
    ]
```

### Advanced Merge Strategies

```bash
# Google's approach: atomic commits
git commit --fixup HEAD~2
git rebase --autosquash main

# Meta's approach: stacked commits
arc diff --create  # Creates reviewable diff
arc land          # Lands after approval
```

## Implementation Strategies for Your Team

### Start Small: Progressive Adoption

**Week 1-2**: Establish baseline
```bash
# Current state assessment
- Measure current merge time
- Identify bottlenecks
- Set up basic CI/CD
```

**Week 3-4**: Reduce branch lifetime
```bash
# Goal: Branches live < 3 days
- Encourage smaller PRs
- Implement feature flags
- Automate testing
```

**Month 2**: Move toward trunk
```bash
# Goal: Most commits go to main
- Direct commits for small changes
- Short-lived branches for larger features
- Continuous deployment
```

### Essential Tooling Setup

```yaml
# .github/workflows/trunk-based.yml
name: Trunk-Based Development
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  fast-feedback:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run unit tests
        run: npm test
        timeout-minutes: 5
      
      - name: Security scan
        run: npm audit
        
      - name: Deploy to staging
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        run: deploy-staging.sh
```

### Feature Flag Implementation

```javascript
// Simple feature flag service
class FeatureFlags {
  constructor() {
    this.flags = new Map();
  }
  
  isEnabled(flagName, userId) {
    const flag = this.flags.get(flagName);
    if (!flag) return false;
    
    // Gradual rollout based on user ID
    return (userId % 100) < flag.rolloutPercentage;
  }
}

// Usage in code
const flags = new FeatureFlags();

function processPayment(payment, userId) {
  if (flags.isEnabled('new-payment-processor', userId)) {
    return newPaymentProcessor.process(payment);
  } else {
    return legacyPaymentProcessor.process(payment);
  }
}
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Problem: "Our PRs are too big"
**Solution**: Enforce size limits
```bash
# Pre-commit hook
if [ $(git diff --cached --numstat | wc -l) -gt 200 ]; then
  echo "PR too large. Consider breaking into smaller changes."
  exit 1
fi
```

### Problem: "Tests take too long"
**Solution**: Parallelize and optimize
```javascript
// Test parallelization strategy
const testSuites = [
  'unit-tests-fast',     // 2 minutes
  'integration-tests',   // 5 minutes  
  'e2e-tests-critical',  // 10 minutes
  'e2e-tests-full'       // 30 minutes (post-merge only)
];
```

### Problem: "Merge conflicts still happen"
**Solution**: Automated conflict resolution
```bash
# Auto-rebase script
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  # Attempt automatic resolution
  git status --porcelain | grep "^UU" | awk '{print $2}' | xargs git checkout --theirs
  git add .
  git rebase --continue
fi
```

## Measuring Success

Track these metrics to gauge your branching strategy effectiveness:

```bash
# Key Performance Indicators
- Mean time to production: < 1 day
- Branch lifetime: < 2 days average
- Merge conflict rate: < 5%
- Build success rate: > 95%
- Rollback frequency: < 1% of deployments
```

## Conclusion

The Git branching strategies used by big tech companies represent a fundamental shift from traditional development workflows. By embracing trunk-based development, feature flags, and extensive automation, these companies achieve remarkable development velocity while maintaining quality.

The key insight isn't just about Git branching—it's about building a development culture that values:
- **Small, frequent changes** over large, risky deployments
- **Automated testing** over manual quality gates  
- **Feature flags** over feature branches
- **Continuous integration** over integration phases

Start your transformation today by reducing branch lifetimes and investing in automation. Your future self (and your team) will thank you.
